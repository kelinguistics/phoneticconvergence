* linear regression model example:

Consider a model that is going to predict AGE as a linear function of HEIGHT_CM
and WALKING_SPEED plus some constant. Thus, mathematically, our predictor looks 
like

  AGE = <value1> * HEIGHT_CM + <value2> * WALKING_SPEED + <value3> * 1

Terminology:
  "<value1> * HEIGHT_CM + <value2> * WALKING_SPEED": this part is called linear
  combination of input variables (features),
  "<value3> * 1": this part is called bias term, <value3> is intercept

Parameters of the model are:
  <value1>, <value2>, <value3>
  
We want to fit our model to the data: that means we want to find the model
parameters that explain the data the best. We use R to find those <values>.
To do that:

1) we have to tell R what our model looks like:

"AGE ~ HEIGHT_CM + WALKING_SPEED + 1"

2) we ask R to optimize parameters (<values>) for this model:

lm(AGE ~ HEIGHT_CM + WALKING_SPEED + 1)

and way may get maybe something like:

AGE = 3.5 * HEIGHT_CM - 11.34 * WALKING_SPEED + 0.3 * 1

* general syntax for model equations:

For variables with real numbers (A, B, C, ...)

# A predicted as a multiple of B plus a constant
A ~ B         # A = <value> * B + <value> * 1

# A predicted as a multiple of B plus a multiple of C plus a constant
A ~ B + C     # A = <value> * B + <value> * C + <value> * 1

# A predicted as a multiple of (B times C), (B times C) is a new variable called cross of B and C
A ~ B : C     # A = <value> * (B * C) + <value> * 1

A ~ B * C:    # Same as "A ~ B + C + B : C".
              # A = <value> * A + <value> * B + <value> * (B * C) + <value> * 1
              
* what happens with categorical variables (factors) with levels

example: SEX with two levels: M, F

# rows:
# AGE.      SEX.    HEIGHT_CM.   WALK_SPEED
# 25          F       145           3
# ....
# 30          M        150          5

AGE ~ SEX + HEIGHT_CM + WALKING_SPEED + 1
   # This model is implementing this mathematical predictor
   # AGE = <value> * (SEX == "M") + <value> * (SEX == "F") + <value> * HEIGHT_CM +
   #   <value> * WALKING_SPEED + <value> * 1
   
For each level LEVEL of categorical variable VAR, you get 
"<value> * (VAR == LEVEL)" as a contribution in the predictor equation. Each
LEVEL has a different <value>. For example, for SEX:
- when SEX == "M", we add some <value> into the predicted regressed value (AGE)
- when SEX == "F", we add some *other* <value> into predicted AGE
[ so each level has a different contribution ]
