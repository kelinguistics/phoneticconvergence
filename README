These files accompany the tutorial and a study on measuring VOT convergence 
scores. Input raw data for the study are stored in two ".csv" tables,
"vot_data.csv" and "model_talker.csv". The tutorial can be run interactively
by stepping through the provider ".r" files in e.g., RStudio. To run the 
tutorial steps top-to-bottom, step through the lines in "run.r".
